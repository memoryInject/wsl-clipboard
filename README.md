Move wclip.exe into `C:\Windows\System32\` or any other Windows file system location that is on system `PATH`.

**NOTE: do not copy wclip.exe in WSL file system location, it will slow down the executaion of Windows applications).

WSL-Clipboard Utility

Blazingly fast Windows clipboard utility for WSL applications and Neovim running under WSL



Flags:
  -h, --help                  Show help
  -o, --output                Output clipboard contents
  -i, --input <input-text>    Input clipboard contents

```

Set clipboard content `wclip.exe -i "Hello world üòÄ"`

```bash
~                                                                                         ‚úò INT
‚ùØ wclip.exe -i "‰Ω†Â•Ω üòÄ"
```

Get clipboard content `wclip.exe -o` or exetute without any flags `wclip.exe`
```bash
‚ùØ wclip.exe --output
‰Ω†Â•Ω üòÄ  
```

It also support pips `echo "Hello world!" | wclip.exe -i`
```bash
~
‚ùØ echo "Hello World! üòé" | wclip.exe -i
~
‚ùØ wclip.exe
Hello World! üòé
```

### wcopy and wpaste usage:
`wcopy and wpaste` are shell script for easy usage in WSL, `wpaste` also remove `CR` at the end of the line which is came from Windows side.

`wcopy` usage, it only support pipes.
`wpaste` will output contents from clipboard, both of them do not support any flags.
```bash
~
‚ùØ echo "Hello" | wcopy
~
‚ùØ wpaste
Hello
```

The main reason these sctipts exists is, it is easy to use with Neovim when we use system clipboard.

### Neovim integration
If you are running Neovim under WSL and want to use system clipboard, add the lua script into your configuration:
```lua
vim.opt.clipboard = "unnamedplus"               -- allows neovim to access the system clipboard

-- Set wsl-clipboard for vim clipboard if running WSL
-- Check if the current linux kernal is microsoft WSL version
local function is_wsl()
  local version_file = io.open("/proc/version", "rb")
  if version_file ~= nil and string.find(version_file:read("*a"), "microsoft") then
    version_file:close()
    return true
  end
  return false
end

-- If current linux is under WSL then use wclip.exe
-- More info: https://github.com/memoryInject/wsl-clipboard
if is_wsl() then
  vim.g.clipboard = {
    name = "wsl-clipboard",
    copy = {
      ["+"] = "wcopy",
      ["*"] = "wcopy"
    },
    paste = {
      ["+"] = "wpaste",
      ["*"] = "wpaste"
    },
    cache_enabled = true
  }
end

```
